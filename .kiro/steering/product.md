# Product Overview

**AuroHear** is a web-based hearing asymmetry screening tool that provides preliminary audiometric testing to detect potential hearing differences between ears.

## Core Functionality
- **Automated Audiometry**: Tests hearing thresholds at standard frequencies (250-5000 Hz) using adaptive algorithms
- **Asymmetry Detection**: Identifies significant interaural differences (≥20 dB) that may indicate unilateral hearing loss
- **Professional Reporting**: Generates downloadable reports (PNG/PDF) with audiogram charts and clinical recommendations

## Target Users
- Healthcare professionals conducting preliminary screenings
- Individuals seeking basic hearing assessment
- Research applications requiring standardized hearing data

## Key Features
- Supabase authentication with guest mode fallback
- Real-time audio generation and calibration
- Interactive audiogram visualization using Chart.js
- Cross-browser audio compatibility with fallback mechanisms
- Professional report generation with patient demographics

## Important Disclaimers
This is a screening tool only - not a diagnostic instrument. All results require professional audiological interpretation for clinical decisions.
